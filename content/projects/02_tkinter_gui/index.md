How do we build a tool into which we load model predictions and can build some overwrite functionalities?   

# Introduction
In this third blog post, I will describe how I built a user interface with the Python interface library Tkinter. The goal of this interface was to visually inspect player and ball predictions and overwrite predictions where the model went wrong. Additionally, one can generate the 3d data in this tool, in which the process is described in the next blog post.
