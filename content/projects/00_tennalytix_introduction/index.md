Is it possible to generate 3d tracking data on 2d Youtube tennis videos? Can we use the data to generate player insights? Those were questions that I tried to tackle in this side project. 

# Introduction
In my master thesis project, I worked with tennis tracking data of professional players that was not publicly available. Analytics in tennis was lacking behind compared to other sports due to limited data access. In this personal side project, my goal was to create 3d tracking data based on 2d Youtube Videos to then analyse the data. 

# Series Overview
This is the first blog post of a series of blog posts in which I describe how I tracked ball and player coordinates, process the data into 3d tracking data and create a Dashboard using Dash to surface the results. 

This blog post series contains the following parts: 
- [About]({{< ref "/projects/00_tennalytix_introduction" >}} "About Us"): How I tracked Player and Ball Pixel Positions on Videos Through Deep Learning Models
- [About]({{< ref "/projects/00_tennalytix_introduction" >}} "About Us"): How I created a GUI (graphic user interface) using Tkinter to be able to manually check and correct predictions
- [About]({{< ref "/projects/00_tennalytix_introduction" >}} "About Us"): How I created 3d spatiotemporal tracking data using pixel location data
- [About]({{< ref "/projects/00_tennalytix_introduction" >}} "About Us"): How I created 3d spatiotemporal tracking data using pixel location data

# tennalytix
In addition to the development efforts, I decided to give this tennis analytics project a meaningful name and call it tennalytix. That's why I will refer to this side project as tennalytix. 

I also created my own logo should it ever be useful: 

# Summary
As you will see in the series, I managed to create my own 3d spatiotemporal tracking data, analyse the data and visualise it in a Dashboard.
