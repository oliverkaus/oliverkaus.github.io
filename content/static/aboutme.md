Hello again! 

I have given a quick introduction in the intro section. Here I want to provide a bit more detail. 

### Professional Background
I work as a Senior Data Scientist for the sports streaming company DAZN. My team is responsible for building, deploying and maintaining various Machine Learning models which range from content demand predictions (e.g. viewership count) to models which predict user behaviour (e.g. churn, re-subscriptions). 

Originally, I am from Dortmund in 🇩🇪 Germany. I studied International Business at 🇳🇱 Maastricht University and 🇭🇰 Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and then decided to move into Computer Science through an intense 1-year programme at 🇬🇧 Imperial College London. (Why this change? Read more [here](test_link)). 

### Hobbies & Interests

In my free time, I love to do sports. I'm a passionate 🎾 tennis player, but also enjoy playing 🏐 beach volleyball or ⚽ football with friends. I try to go ⛷️ skiing every year and recently started kite surfing 🪁. 

I enjoy 🌎 backpacking and have travelled several countries so far (hopefully more to come when the pandemic is over):
- China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, Mexico, Belize, Colombia, Portugal and Spain

I also like 📚 reading, especially in the mornings before work. Some books that inspired me:

- The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
- The Miracle Morning (I try to follow part of the routine)
